Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (\u00c2\u00a34.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe. Samsung Electronics has said it has goods worth about $38m on Hanjin ships in international waters. It is now considering chartering 16 freighter planes to take goods to customers - mostly in the US.",

Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes in the nation's ports for several weeks; at the time of the filing it was estimated to cost the carrier up to $1.7 billion. The Korean ferry company Yonghungpyo, which ferries Korean tourists across the peninsula between Seoul and Incheon, said in October it had rejected all Hanjin cargo because the carriers weren't providing the required level of insurance. Hanjin has asked Yonghungpyo and other transport companies to accept the cargo, which is considered \"goods\" for Korean government shipping purposes, if it returns to the carriers in the country of origin on Hanjin ships. Despite that, the South Korean government has not ruled out the use of emergency measures to prevent the ships from leaving.\n\nOn Monday, several hours after The Wall Street Journal broke the story that Hanjin intended to seek receivership",
